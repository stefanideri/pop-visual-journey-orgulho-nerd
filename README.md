Documentation and original assets from my Behance project: Between Icons and Emotion

## 🧪 Creative Process

This section outlines the key techniques and tools used to transform the original photos into the final compositions featured in the Behance project.

### 🎨 Lighting & Composition

- ** Father Portrait – Lighting Test **
  Two versions were captured with different lighting setups.  
  - *Image 1*: Cooler tones, neutral background  
  - *Image 2*: Warmer tones, stronger emotional impact → **Selected as final**
  - ![Father Image 2](pop-visual-journey-orgulho-nerd/Papai01pose01.jpg)



- **Michael Jackson – Pose & Framing**  
  The statue was photographed from multiple angles to emphasize posture and depth.  
  Comic-style framing was added to enhance visual rhythm.

### 🛠️ Editing & Reconstruction

- **Batman – Cape Reconstruction**  
  The original image lacked cape motion.  
  Photoshop’s warp and clone tools were used to digitally rebuild the cape, restoring dynamic flow.

- **Elvis Presley – AI Refinement**  
  The raw image was enhanced using [AirBrush](https://airbrush.com/pt/image-enhancer), improving texture and clarity.  
  Final version was blended with manual edits to preserve consistency across the series.

### 🤖 Generative AI

- **Banner Expansion**  
  The pixel-art promotional poster was adapted to horizontal format using Google AI Studio.  
  Prompt used:  
  ```plaintext
  Transform this vertical pixel-art image into a horizontal 16:9 version, keeping the central character and extending the background with matching style and colors.

 ## 🖼️ Final Results
Here are the final compositions featured in the Behance project. Each image was carefully refined using a combination of manual editing and AI enhancement to preserve texture, emotion, and visual rhythm.

- `edited/elvis_final.jpg` → Elvis Presley after AirBrush refinement and texture blending  
- `edited/batman_final.jpg` → Batman with digitally reconstructed cape  
- `edited/pai_final.jpg` → Final portrait of my father with warm lighting  
- `edited/michael_final.jpg` → Comic-style framing and pose emphasis  
- `edited/wanda_final.jpg` → Mystical composition with color grading

## 🧵 Behind the Scenes

This project was born from a personal and cultural moment — the Orgulho Nerd SP event held at Parque Ibirapuera in São Paulo, Brazil. The sculptures and banners served as visual anchors, while my father’s portrait became the emotional core.

### Tools & Techniques

- **Photoshop** → Cape reconstruction, compositing, and texture blending  
- **Lightroom** → Color grading and lighting adjustments  
- **AirBrush** → AI-based image enhancement  
- **Google AI Studio** → Generative prompts for background expansion

### Creative Decisions

- Choosing warmer lighting for emotional resonance  
- Reframing statues with comic-style layouts  
- Blending manual edits with AI outputs for consistency  
- Documenting the process to share both the art and the technique
